## Randomized Coffee Trial Streamlit app

This is a basic Streamlit frontend for sending emails to pairs of people. It was created to support the Randomized Coffee Trials at the Strategy Unit, which is an initiative intended to encourage collaboration and camaraderie within the organisation.

Note that the CSVs and pairs are currently manually generated by a member of the People/Staff Development and Wellbeing team, YiWen Hon, who also maintains this repo.

Companion repository: rct_api which is a Flask API. Both apps need to be deployed to work.
