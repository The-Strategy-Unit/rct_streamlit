# Randomized Coffee Trial Streamlit app

This is a basic Streamlit frontend for sending emails to pairs of people. It was created to support the [Randomized Coffee Trials](https://library.hee.nhs.uk/binaries/content/assets/kls/knowledge-mobilsation/knowledge-mobilisation-toolkit/sharing-the-right-information/randomised-coffee-trials-postcards.pdf) at the Strategy Unit, which is an initiative intended to encourage collaboration and camaraderie within the organisation.

Note that the CSVs and pairs are currently manually generated by a member of the People/Staff Development and Wellbeing team, YiWen Hon, who also maintains this repo.

Companion repository: rct_api which is a Flask API. Both apps need to be deployed to work.

You will need in your environment:

- APP_URL
- API_KEY
